# firstNeuralNet


This is my first working nueral network and my first full project in C++. It is not very accute or useful, but it was my first attempt to learn the mathmatics behind backpropagation and gradient decent (as well as my attempt to learn c++ with a strong foundation in C but no specific c++ knowlege. The 5 node structure of the neural net is largely based on the the demistifing nueral networks series by Welch Labs.
