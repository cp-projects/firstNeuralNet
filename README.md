# firstNeuralNet 

This is my first working neural network and my first full project in C++. It is not very accurate or useful, but it was my first attempt to learn the mathematics behind backpropagation and gradient decent (as well as my attempt to learn C++ with a strong foundation in C but no specific C++ knowledge. The 5-node structure of the neural net is largely based on the demystifying neural networks series by Welch Labs.
